The \"boa\" program allows attackers to modify the value of the \"vwlan_idx\" field via \"formMultiAP\". This can lead to a stack overflow through the \"formWlEncrypt\" CGI function by constructing malicious HTTP requests and passing a WLAN SSID value exceeding the expected length, potentially resulting in command execution or denial of service attacks.",
