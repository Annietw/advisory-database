  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfork: defer linking file vma until vma is fully initialized\n\nThorvald reported a WARNING [1].

Fix this\nby deferring linking file vma until vma is fully initialized.  Those vmas\nshould be initialized first before they can be used.",
